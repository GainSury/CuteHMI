Problem:

While building project only single CPU core is ever used.

Explanation:

By default GNU Make is processing targets in sequential manner. GCC is using single thread
for each compilation unit, thus only one CPU core is utilized.

Solution:

To enable parallel builds use Make with "-j N" option, where N is number of tasks performed in parallel.
This way N compilation units will be processed at the same time.
N should correspond to number of CPU cores. In QtCreator this can be done by providing "Make arguments" in
Projects > Build & Run.
