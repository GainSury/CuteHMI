Problem: 

QtDesigner does not render component imported from custom QML module.

Explanation:

If custom QML module contains plugin and plugin depends on other libraries, QtCreator must be 
able to load all required dependencies.

Solution:

Create script, which will run QtCreator and add directories containing required 
libraries to PATH environmental variable.
