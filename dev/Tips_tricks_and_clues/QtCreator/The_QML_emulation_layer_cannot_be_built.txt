Problem: 

QtDesigner prints error message: "The QML emulation layer (QML Puppet) cannot be built" and
falls back to QML emulation layer provided by QtCreator.

Explanation:

Problem occurs when path to QtCreator settings contains space(s). Qt is known for having troubles
building projects, which contain spaces. It seems that settings path is somehow involved when 
building QML emulation layer. Default path may contain spaces.

Solution:

Run QtCreator with -settingspath option: qtcreator.exe -settingspath path_without_spaces
