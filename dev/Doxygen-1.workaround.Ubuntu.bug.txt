Problem:

Doxygen 1.8.14 is not available under Ubuntu (Sept. 2018). Compared to previous
version Doxygen 1.8.14 brings some new configuration options. These options are
not recognized by previous version of Doxygen. Building Doxygen from sources
is an option, but unfortunately LLVM libraries are (were) messed up under 
Ubuntu 18.04. CMake is not able to find LLVM libraries, even when manually 
adjusted, some files are at wrong locations and it's a mess.

Workaround:

Compile Doxygen from sources, but turn off Clang assisted parsing and disable
CLANG_* options for now.

Snippet:
