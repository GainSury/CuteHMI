Problem:

Sometimes bug in external library requires some sort of workaround code to overcome an issue. 
This workaround code may not be the best one. Implementation could be better if only such bug 
had not existed.

Workaround:

Wrap such code in <workaround id="id" target="target"></workaround> tags.
Attribute "id" is an identifier of workaround. Attribute "target" is a piece of software, which
causes the problem. Additionaly create workaround.target.id in relevant dev directory.
After the bug has been fixed in target software, it should be easier to find affected code and improve it.

Snippet:

//<workaround id="id" target="target">
Optional code snippet.
//</workaround>
