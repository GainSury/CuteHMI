It would be nice to use dictionary method for error messages. Less mess and each error could have a code, which makes user support easier. Errors should be deivided in two cathegories: userspace errors and 
system errors. Userspace errors are errors that are part of normal functioning of an application (for
example error is triggered, because user has not configured device properly). Second type is to provide debugging info when something fails in a bit surprising way.
