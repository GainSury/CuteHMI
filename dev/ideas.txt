0.0 Ideas file [implemented]

This file contains description of loose ideas for further implementation or 
abandonment. A status may be provided in square brackets after idea number 
and title.


1.0 Error codes [partially implemented]

It would be nice to use dictionary method for error messages. Less mess and
each error could have a code, which makes user support easier. Errors should
be deivided in two cathegories: userspace errors and system errors. Userspace
errors are errors that are part of normal functioning of an application (for
example error is triggered, because user has not configured device properly).
Second type is to provide debugging info when something fails in a bit
surprising way.

base::Error class partially implements the idea.


2.0 Extended error [implemented]

Provide base::ExtError class with details() method for detailed error messages.


3.0 Overlay or decoration layer [not implemented]

Sometimes an item has to be placed on top of other items, while retaining its
position. Moving up in the hierarchy of parents can be cumbersome. It would be
nice to have a QML component, which would make all the necessary work for us.
Such component would track position of item taking into account all its parents
up to the overlay itself. To mark item for tracking and reparent it to the
overlay an attached property could be used (for example "Overlay.attach: true").
