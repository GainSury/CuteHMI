Problem:

Doxygen (1.8.14) is missing functionality to preserve source directory structure for the output. This causes problems when creating
relative links from 'README.md' files located in subdirectories such as 'QML' or 'modules'. They should work correctly on GitLab,
GitHub and inside Doxygen generated documentation, but Doxygen generated output is flat, signle directory.

Workaround:

Each documented subdirectory is given a Doxyfile with output directory specified manually. This allows us to use relative links
within Doxygen docs.

Snippet:
