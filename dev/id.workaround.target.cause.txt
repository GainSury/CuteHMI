Problem:

Sometimes bug, missing component or another issue in an external software requires some 
sort of workaround to overcome an issue. The workaround approach may not be the best one. 
Implementation could be better if only such issue had not existed.

Workaround:

If workaround is applied to the code, wrap workaround code in
<workaround id="id" target="target" cause="cause"></workaround> tag comment.
Attribute "id" is an identifier of workaround. 
Attribute "target" is a piece of software, which causes the problem. 
Attribute "cause" indicates a cause of a problem. Typical causes include:
	bug - bug in external piece of software. If bug has been reported an id of a bug
		should be provided (i.e. cause="QTBUG-47987").
	missing - missing functionality in external software.

Additionaly create id.workaround.target.cause.txt file in relevant "dev" directory and describe the workaround.

After the issue has been resolved in target software, it should be easier to find affected code and improve it.

Snippet:

//<workaround id="id" target="target" cause="cause">
Optional code snippet.
//</workaround>
