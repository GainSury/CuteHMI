Problem:

Doxygen currently (1.18.7) does not support QML types natively. There is no "normal" way to document classes that are registered as
QML types.

Workaround:

As a workaround C++ pseudo-classes that mock QML types can be defined specifically for Doxygen pass. This is possible only when
Doxygen preprocessing is enabled and some macro is designated for Doxygen pass. For this we use DOXYGEN_WORKAROUND macro.

Snippet:
