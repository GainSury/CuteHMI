Problem:

Individual channels can not be run in individual threads, because of limitted threading capabilities of libssh.

http://api.libssh.org/master/libssh_tutor_threads.html

Additionaly some functions can not be used from different threads, because they are not reentrant.

"libssh is not reentrant here. That means that if a signal is caught during the processing of this function, you cannot call libssh functions on sessions that are busy with ssh_select()." -- http://api.libssh.org/master/group__libssh__session.html#ga86cbf041bced56d18a2a5248c46cecb4

Investigation:

Workaround:

Use collective thread for channels.
