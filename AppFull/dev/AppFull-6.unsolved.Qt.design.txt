Problem:

QMessageBox can not be made resizeable in a normal way. 
It would be desirable to resize QMessageBox sometimes.

Investigation:

QMessageBox::updateSize() is called in many places, including QMessageBox::event() and QMessageBox::showEvent(). Function updateSize() seems to enforce fixed size.

QMessageBox::updateSize()
{
...
q->setFixedSize(width, height);
...
}
