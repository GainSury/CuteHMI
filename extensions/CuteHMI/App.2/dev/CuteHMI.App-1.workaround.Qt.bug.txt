Problem:

MessageDialog (QtQuick.Dialogs 1.2) misbehaves badly. Signal 'onRejected' is not
triggered, if dialog is closed via 'X' button. Additionaly when user presses one
of the 'standardButtons' 'onClickedButtonChanged' is emitted after(!)
'onVisibleChanged', so there is no way to determine if dialog was closed by 'X'
button or by one of the 'standardButtons' and 'Prompt' expects only single call
to `acceptResponse`. Attempts to force dialog to stay visible by setting
'visible = true' ended up with failure...

Investigation:

In theory 'Qt.labs.platform 1.0' could replace 'QtQuickDialogs 1.2', but after a
bit of testing it came out that for now implementation is immature and buggy.

Workaround:

Using 'QApplication' instead of 'QGuiApplication' made 'onRejected' signal work
as expected. Additionaly QApplication fixed lack of "beep" sound, when dialog
shows up. The price is that application has to be linked against 'widgets'
module.
