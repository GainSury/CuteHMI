# Bitcoin Cash

![Development status](doc/status-unmaintained.svg)

This extension provides Bitcoin Cash operations through Bitcoin.com REST API.

Currently only monitoring of Bitcoin Cash addresses is supported. To monitor an address one can use Address class.

## Status of this extension

This extension no longer works, because Bitcoin.com REST API v1 became unavailable.
