## AbstractDevice API

AbstractDevice uses JSON objects for requests and replies.

Using JSON instead of full blown objects has an advantage for an API to be light-weight, flexible and it fits naturally into
QML/JavaScript. The drawbacks may seem to be a performance overhead, but JSON objects are implicitly shared in Qt, so it should not
be a problem in most cases. Another problem is type safety, but this can be compensated with validation and sanitization.
JSON-based API also offers interesting possibilities in terms of forwarding it to web REST API.
