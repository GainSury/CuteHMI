Problem:

Qt Model/View doesn't take into account indirect const-correctness.

QAbstractItemModel::createIndex(), in overriden ProjectModel::index() const, expects 
non-const pointer to child node. Child node can affect parent however, so for given 
parent to obtain its non-const child, a non-const version of child() function should  
be used. Because root node is a member of ProjectModel non-const root.child() can not 
be called in ProjectModel::index() const.

Workaround:

Use const_cast to remove const from root node.

Snippet:

Solution:

ProjectModel has been removed from CuteHMI.2.
