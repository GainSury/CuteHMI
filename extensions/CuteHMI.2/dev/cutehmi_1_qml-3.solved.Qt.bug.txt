Problem:

When trying to connect Emitter::emitParticles(Array particles) signal using 
"emitParticles.connect(onEmitParticlesOnce)" syntax, onEmitParticlesOnce() does not receive particles
argument as an Array, but a QVariant(QQmlV4Handle) object.

Workaround:

Use Connections component to connect emitParticles() with onEmitParticlesOnce() function. This
has a drawback that each new instance of Connections (which has not null "target") seems to 
reconnect old emitters to the onEmitParticlesOnce() (bug?). This isn't a big deal as they 
are disconnected altogether by onEmitParticlesOnce() again.

Snippet:

Solution:

Pipe componenent is abandoned.
