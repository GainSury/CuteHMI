Problem:

When evaluating QQmlExpression Qt prints all encountered errors to the console, so that when using custom error handling they may
appear twice. What's worse not all QML errors are being printed, so a program, which wishes to print all QML errors can't rely on
this behaviour either.

Investigation:

There are many locations, where QML engine prints warnings without hesitate, but the most relevant series of functions seems to be
dumpwarning() defined in `qqmlengine.cpp`
[file](https://code.woboq.org/qt5/qtdeclarative/src/qml/qml/qqmlengine.cpp.html#_ZL11dumpwarningRK9QQmlError).
