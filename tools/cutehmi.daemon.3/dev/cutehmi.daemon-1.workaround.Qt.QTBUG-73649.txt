Problem:

Class QQmlApplicationEngine connects Qt.quit() signal to
QCoreApplication::quit() and QQmlApplicationEngine::exit() signal to
QCoreApplication::exit(), but it does so with AutoConnection. This causes in
some circumstances problems, which are described in Qt documentation.

"It's good practice to always connect signals to this slot using a
QueuedConnection. If a signal connected (non-queued) to this slot is emitted
before control enters the main event loop (such as before "int main" calls
exec()), the slot has no effect and the application never exits. Using a queued
connection ensures that the slot will not be invoked until after control enters
the main event loop." -- Qt documentation on QCoreApplication::exit().

Investigation:

File qtdeclarative/src/qml/qml/qqmlapplicationengine.cpp contains method
QQmlApplicationEnginePrivate::init(), which contains following lines.

```
q->connect(q, SIGNAL(quit()), QCoreApplication::instance(), SLOT(quit()));
q->connect(q, &QQmlApplicationEngine::exit, QCoreApplication::instance(), &QCoreApplication::exit);
```

Workaround:

Disconnect signals and connect them again with QueuedConnection.
