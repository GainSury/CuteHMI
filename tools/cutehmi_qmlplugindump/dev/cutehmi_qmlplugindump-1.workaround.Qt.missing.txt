Problem:

Program _qmlplugindump_, which is shipped with Qt can be used only with release version of Qt libraries. Attempt to generate
_qmlptypes_ files with debug version of libraries ends with error message: "cannot mix debug and release libraries".

Workaround:

A workaround is to provide own fork of _qmlplugindump_, which can be build in debug mode and use it instead of _qmlplugindump_
provided with Qt.
