Problem:

When changing window visibility in the following manner:
Window.Windowed -> Window.Maximized -> Window.FullScreen -> Window.Maximized -> Window.Windowed,
window does not return to its original size.

Investigation:

Simply restoring settings when going from Window.FullScreen to Window.Maximized does not help, 
because explicitly setting x, y, width and height affects the window even if it is maximized.
