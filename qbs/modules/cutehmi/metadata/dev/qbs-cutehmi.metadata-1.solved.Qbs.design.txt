Problem:

If a plugin uses Q_PLUGIN_METADATA macro and specifies auto-generated
'cutehmi.metadata.json' file for metadata, this file has to be generated before
executing the C++ toolchain. Both 'cutehmi.metadata.json' and
'cutehmi.metadata.hpp' are specified as artifacts for respective product types,
but the C++ and metadata builds seem to be performed by Qbs in parallel, which
leads to a race condition and successful build depends on whether metadata files
were generated first.

Workaround:

As a workaround metadata arifacts are added to a Group and they are given 'hpp'
file tag, which hopefuly affects Qbs build graph (rules of Qbs 'cpp' module use
'hpp' tagged files as inputs for other rules)

Snippet:

Solution:

Appropriate file tags have been found. These are 'qt.core.resource_data',
'qt_plugin_metadata' in 'Qt.core' module.
