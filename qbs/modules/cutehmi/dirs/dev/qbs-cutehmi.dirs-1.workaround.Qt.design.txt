Problem:

The problem is a clash between default QML import path set by Qt for Android and CuteHMI directory tree. Going into details - Qt
expects us to install all the extensions in the 'qml' directory (which would be later referred by Qt.android_support.extraPlugins
property), but CuteHMI by default installs extensions in the 'bin' directory.

Workaround:

Workaround is to change installation path of extension files with property 'extensionInstallDirname'.
