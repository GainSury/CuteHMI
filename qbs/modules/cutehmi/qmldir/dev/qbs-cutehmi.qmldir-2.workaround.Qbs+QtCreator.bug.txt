Problem:

When files are added to the product from Qt Creator it seems Qbs is not able to populate 'explicitlyDependsOn' list with newly added
files.

Investigation:

If Qbs 'files' property is editted from editor, new files oddly appear within 'explicitlyDependsOn' property so as a remedy one
could modify Qbs file by hand...

Workaround:

Workaround is to use 'inputs' instead of 'explicitlyDependsOn' and 'inputsFromDependencies' rather than
'explicitlyDependsOnFromDependencies'.

Snippet:
