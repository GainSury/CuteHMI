Problem:

Qbs does not propagate information about disabled products accross dependencies.
This leads to compilation errors, when project is being built from a console (Qt
Creator tracks dependencies on its own to some extent; tho' it crashes when it
has to deal with special cases). Option `--keep-going` does not help.

Workaround:

A workaround is to use 'cutehmi.product' module to propagate information about
disabled products.
