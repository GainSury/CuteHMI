Problem:

Doxygen (1.8.14) is missing functionality to create output directories recursively.

"The default output directory is the directory in which doxygen is started. The root directory to which the output is written can be changed using the OUTPUT_DIRECTORY. The format specific directory within the output directory can be selected using the HTML_OUTPUT, RTF_OUTPUT, LATEX_OUTPUT, XML_OUTPUT, MAN_OUTPUT, and DOCBOOK_OUTPUT. tags of the configuration file. If the output directory does not exist, doxygen will try to create it for you (but it will not try to create a whole path recursively, like mkdir -p does)."

Workaround:

Output directories have to be created by Qbs script in order to avoid "Output directory [...] does not exist and cannot be created" error.

Snippet:
