Problem:

Doxygen (1.8.14) is missing functionality to preserve source directory structure for the output. This causes problems when creating
relative links from 'README.md' files located in subdirectories such as 'QML' or 'modules'. They should work correctly on
Github, Github pages and inside Doxygen generated documentation, but Doxygen generated output is flat, signle directory.

Workaround:

To make relative links work properly in this setup, first directory of the product location has to be
stripped (e.g., 'cutehmi_1' instead of 'modules/cutehmi_1').

Snippet:

docDir +  '/' + FileInfo.relativePath(project.sourceDirectory, product.sourceDirectory).split('/').slice(1).join('/') // Absolute.

Solution:

Problem has been delegated to "Doxygen-2" workaround (see "dev" in top level project directory).
