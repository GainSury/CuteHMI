Problem:

Property 'type' can be conditionaly specified with "autotest" value, but when
condition involves complex evaluation of module parameters such as
'cutehmi.product.enabled' (probably causing some re-evaluation) AutotestRunner
will not conform to the final results, but rather stick to some initial results
(branch that specifies "autotest").

Workaround:

Using 'condition' seems to resolve the issue. No product should depend on a test
product, so no product should be affected by "qbs-imports-cutehmi-1.workaround".
