Problem:

Property 'qmlDesignerImportPaths' (or its Qmake counterpart 'QML_DESIGNER_IMPORT_PATH') allows one to mock only C++ types in
Qt Designer. Moreover "render mode" sometimes does not display mockup type, while "preview mode" (view with states) does.

Investigation:

NodeInstanceView explicitly checks for C++ types when creating a scene and setting up 'mockupTypesVector'
('qt-creator\src\plugins\qmldesigner\designercore\instances\nodeinstanceview.cpp:929' #9298bf8ff8683a5e9576b33ed6e8c14b2286b828).

Due to time constrainst it has not been investigated why "preview mode" does display some components, while "render mode" not.

Workaround:

Instead of using 'qmlDesignerImportPaths' one can prepend 'qmlImportPaths' with additional path for mockup types to achieve desired
functionality. It should not be a problem to "Edit" mode to encounter mockup/puppet version of an extension rather than original
one.
