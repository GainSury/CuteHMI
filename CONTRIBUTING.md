CuteHMI uses [Artistic Style 3.1](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) to format C++ code.

When it comes to coding conventions, [Qt Coding Conventions](https://wiki.qt.io/Coding_Conventions) are used with few exceptions.
- Exceptions are allowed.
- It is allowed to inherit from template classes (CuteHMI uses namespaces everywhere, so symbol clashes should not be a problem).
- Whether exact or fuzzy float comparisons should be performed depends on a case (sometimes exact comparisons are desired).
- It comes out acronyms in class names are not lowercased (CuteHMI, not CuteHmi).
