Problem:

Particles in a Pipe component are normally relying on "autoRotate" property. However particles emitted 
from the past (Emitter has startTime parameter set to positive value) are not rotated correctly.

Investigation:

Weirdly this does not happen when previously loaded screen does not contain a Pipe with particle system.
It's worth to note that new Emitters are being created before the old ones are destroyed.
Maybe it's possible to get rid of this bug, by fine-tuning destruction of objects. For now particles are
rotated manually (see workaround below).

Workaround:

Rotate "past" particles manually. It is possible to achieve by catching Emitter::emitParticles() signal
and then disconnecting from it.

Snippet:
