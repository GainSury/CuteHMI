Problem:

QML plugin class name has to be specified in "qmldir" file. Normally this class
would be wrapped in a namespace to avoid name clashes, but to avoid potential problems
with "qmldir" it's probably better to not use namespaces.

Workaround:

Because this class is used only by QML plugin system, long class name can be used instead of a namespace.
