  \brief Modbus coil item.

  Coil item is intended to interact with \a parent item in which it can be placed. By default \a parent item is
  set as a delegate of \a controller.

  This class is provided as a supplement to CoilController to bypass limitations of QML Designer and make it
  possible to work in QML "design" mode directly. In addition it provides its own visuals to show
  \a controller.busy status.
