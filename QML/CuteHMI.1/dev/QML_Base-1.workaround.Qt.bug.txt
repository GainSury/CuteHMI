Problem:

After setting environmental variable QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE=Flat as documentation suggests Qt desktop application does not use flat style properly.

Workaround:

It seems that explicit import of QtQuick.Controls.Styles.Flat overcomes this bug.

Snippet:

// <workaround id="QML_Base-1" target="Qt" cause="bug">
// After setting environmental variable QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE=Flat as documentation suggests Qt desktop application does not use flat style properly,
// although no warnings are printed to the output (as they normally should, if style can not be loaded). It seems that explicit import overcomes this bug.
// [It may be that QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE is not doing regular import and it's not dealing with plugin library correctly.]
import QtQuick.Controls.Styles.Flat 1.0
import QtQuick.Extras 1.0	// To surpass "QtQuick.Extras.Private is not installed" ComboBox error, when using Flat style.
// </workaround>
