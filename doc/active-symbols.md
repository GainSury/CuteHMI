# Active symbols

Active symbols are a concept by which standard engineering symbols are given
multimedia features, such as color, sound and animations, in order to extend
information provided by standard schematics. Such information typically carries
the actual state of an equipment and it is often propagated by some sort of
industrial communication protocol.
