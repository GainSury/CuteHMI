Problem:

On Windows Findutils find (version 4.4.2) provided with mingw32 is buggy. It
won't properly change working directory within `execdir` command, when searching
for `doc\Doxyfile` and `external\Doxyfile` files. Because of that generated
documentation will be missing those directories.


Investigation:

Newer versions of find work as expected.


Solution:

One can replace mingw32 find with more recent version if one needs these
directories to be generated on Windows. Path to find program can be overriden
with `Makefile.user` file.

Anyways mingw32 is becomming obsolete and switching to mingw64 is desired.
