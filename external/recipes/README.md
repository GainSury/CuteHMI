# External libraries recipes.

This directory is intended to keep Make recipes that allow the software to be
build from scratch for a specified target platform. Each subdirectory is given
a name, which relates to a target triplet for which the software is meant to be
built.

Description above is pompous, but there's only one toolchain supported.

- [i686-w64-mingw32](i686-w64-mingw32/README.md) - Windows mingw32 recipes.
