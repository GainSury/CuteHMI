# GNU libiconv (internationalized)

__Possible__ MinGW port of [GNU libiconv][libiconv-www] with native language support.

According to [libiconv website][libiconv-www] iconv program should be
recompiled for the second time and linked against gettext.

*Leaving it for now until internationalized iconv is required.*
